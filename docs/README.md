# Hi, I’m Aditya Gaurav 👋

### Senior Frontend Engineer | UI/UX Architect | Open Source Contributor

I specialize in building scalable, high-performance web applications with a focus on **developer experience (DX)** and **user-centric design**. With over **4.5+** years of experience, I bridge the gap between complex backend systems and intuitive user interfaces.

---

## 🚀 Professional Philosophy

* **Scalability over Speed:** I build design systems and component libraries that empower teams to move faster without breaking things.
* **Performance as a Feature:** If it's not fast, it's not finished. I prioritize Core Web Vitals and efficient state management.
* **Mentorship:** I believe a Senior Developer's success is measured by the growth of the juniors around them.
